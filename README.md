# Convolution-Neural-Network---Classification-of-Images--Dog-or-Cat-
Deep Learning using Convolution Neural Network is a way of filtering images according to their pixel values thereby extracting new optimum value for accurate prediction output through multiple processes.


Introduction specific to Cat and Dog using Convolution Neural Network: This dataset is made up of cat and dog images. We will be creating a model that can allow us to predict new image if it is a cat or a dog. 


Conducting multiple experiments for hyperparameter tuning is daunting but it is worth it. A lot of that was done on this project before achieving the accuracy of 0.8404
